# DigitalTwinning
This project implements a Digital Twin for a titration experiment, allowing students to seamlessly transition between a physical and virtual lab environment. The system collects real-time data from an ESP32 microcontroller and stores it in a Ganache blockchain server to ensure data integrity and security.
